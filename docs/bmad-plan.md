# BMAD Plan — `spam-detector/`

**Method:** BMAD (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development)
**Project scope:** `spam-detector/` (Text Classification — Project B)
**Sibling project:** `meme-classifier/` carries its own copy of this plan, scoped to Project A
**Conventions:** kebab-case for all folders · snake_case for all Python files (PEP 8) · append-only `PROMPTS_LOG.md` at root

## 1. Agent Personas

| Persona | Responsibility | Primary Outputs |
|---|---|---|
| **PM Agent** | Define specs, user stories, acceptance criteria, scope control | `docs/product-requirements.md` |
| **Architect Agent** | System design, module boundaries, model/tech decisions, risk register | `docs/system-architecture.md` |
| **Dev Agent** | Clean, modular, typed implementation; unit tests | Source modules + `tests/` |
| **QA Agent** | Adversarial code review, edge-case attacks, defense prep | Test hardening, review notes, Q&A defense sheet |

The Tech Lead (human-directed) orchestrates phase transitions and owns `PROMPTS_LOG.md` hygiene.

## 2. Phases & Status Board — Project B

| # | Phase | Persona | Deliverable | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Kickoff & scaffolding | Tech Lead | Project tree, `PROMPTS_LOG.md`, README stubs | **Done** (INIT-001) |
| 0b | BMAD runtime install | Tech Lead | One `bmad-method` instance per project folder: `_bmad/` + 72 skills → `.agents/skills` + 72 commands → `.opencode/commands`; modules `bmm, bmad-loop, bmb, cis, tea, wds` (`gds`/game-dev **excluded**) | **Done** (INIT-002) |
| 0c | Docs relocated into project | Tech Lead | PRD, architecture, and this plan moved from parent `docs/` into `spam-detector/docs/` so this instance's agents can scan them | **Done** (INIT-003) |
| 1 | Requirements | PM Agent | PRD + acceptance criteria | **Done** (INIT-001 output) |
| 2 | System design | Architect Agent | Architecture doc + module contracts | **Done** (INIT-001 output) |
| 3 | Implementation — spam-detector | Dev Agent | Working TF-IDF + MultinomialNB CLI | **Done** (scaffold + tests; FR-B1..B7 implemented) |
| 5 | Adversarial review | QA Agent | Edge-case tests, review fixes, security pass | Pending |
| 6 | Defense prep | QA Agent | Demo script, professor Q&A sheet | Pending |

> Phase **4** (Implementation — meme-classifier) belongs to the sibling project and is tracked in
> `meme-classifier/docs/bmad-plan.md`.

**Phase transition rule:** a phase is Done only when (a) its artifacts exist, (b) all prompts are logged, (c) Tech Lead signs off.

---

## 3. Definition of Done (per phase)

1. **PM:** every lab-reference requirement traced to an FR ID; acceptance criteria testable.
2. **Architect:** every module has a single responsibility; no circular imports; data flow documented.
3. **Dev:** `python -m compileall` clean; `pytest` green; no `print` debugging; type hints on public APIs; docstrings on public functions.
4. **QA:** adversarial cases covered (stdin EOF, single-class data, missing dataset file, unstratifiable data); review comments resolved or documented.

---

## 4. Prompt Logging Protocol

- Every user → AI prompt gets a unique ID `<PHASE>-<NNN>` in **root** `PROMPTS_LOG.md`.
- Prompts are logged **verbatim** with date, persona, artifacts, and status.
- Re-prompts and corrections are new entries (never overwrite old ones).
- ID prefixes: `INIT`, `PM`, `ARCH`, `DEV`, `QA`.

## 5. Known Risks (Project B)

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| SMS Spam Collection CSV absent | Loader has no data | Built-in fallback dataset (23 labelled tuples per lab sheet) + shipped `data/sample_sms.csv` |
| Tiny fallback dataset | Inflated/low metrics | Stratified split + explicit "demo dataset" warning in CLI output |
| Folder naming conflict (spec said `spam_detector`) | Non-compliance either way | kebab-case folders enforced per explicit convention; inner Python modules snake_case (PEP 8 / import validity) |
| `project_knowledge` only scans `<project>/docs` | Parent-level docs invisible to this instance's agents | All project docs now live in this folder (INIT-003) |
